## NAN_METHOD()

The version of V8 shipping with Node.js 0.10 and prior uses a signature for methods that are exposed into JavaScript that is *completely* different to that of the V8 in 0.11 and later. This complexity is hidden from you by NAN via the `NAN_METHOD` macro. We will see later how this provides you with a consistent `info` array and how you can return values into JavaScript from your C++. It may be slightly opaque to read, but hey, this is C++ so opacity is mandatory!
